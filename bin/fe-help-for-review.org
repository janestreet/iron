** rename

: rename a feature (and all features below it)
: 
:   fe.exe rename FEATURE [FEATURE]
: 
: The target feature is not restricted to be a sibling of the original feature, i.e.
: renaming [jane/a/b] to [jane/c] (or vice versa) is permissible.
: 
: Using [-skip-gca-check] skips the check that the greatest common ancestor of the current
: tip and the new base is the current base.  Skipping the check may mean future rebases and
: renames will be rejected.
: 
: When the basename of the feature is not meant to change, one can use [-new-parent].
: For example, to rename [jane/a/keep-this-basename] into [jane/b/keep-this-basename]:
: 
:   $ fe rename jane/a/keep-this-basename -new-parent jane/b

: The command synthesizes a review session containing all the requested changes, and

: - trying to understand a merge, allowing to see a diff the way fe would have shown it
