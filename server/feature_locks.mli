(* The versioning of these types is done separately:

   - in [feature.ml] limited to [sexp], because it is much more flexible than [bin_io],
   and we will probably be able to get by using [sexp_option] and such.

   - in [protocol/lock_feature.ml], and we will decide what version we want to support
   there.  Could be different from the persistent versions kept alive.
