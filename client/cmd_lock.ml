[fe lock] can be used to prevent users from performing certain actions on a feature.
For example, [fe lock -release] will prevent users from releasing a feature.

[fe lock] can be used to change the reason for an existing lock or lock new locks.
Modifying existing locks can be done only by the person who locked them.
For example:

  $ fe lock -rebase          -reason 'initial reason'
  $ fe lock -rebase -release -reason 'updated reason'

Locks may be made permanent by supplying [" ; switch_permanent
             ; "] as a way to emphasis that
the lock is intended for a non transient period.  For example, certain features
are not meant to be ever released.

Use [fe unlock] to unlock a lock.  To see what is locked for a feature, use:

  $ fe show "; Switch.what_is_locked; " [FEATURE]
"])
